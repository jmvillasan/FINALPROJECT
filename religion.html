			<h1> HOA1 </h1>
				<p> Objectives:<br>
				1.1. Create and configure Virtual Machines in Microsoft Azure or VirtualBox<Br>
				1.2. Set-up a Virtual Network and Test Connectivity of VMs<br><br>

				<b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
				We can use hostname instead of ip address by inputting the ip addresses of
				hosts in the sudo nano /etc/hosts the name of host and their respective ip
				address. SSH is secured because all connections are encrypted and authenticated
				using SSH. SSH offers IT and information security (infosec) professionals a
				secure mechanism for remotely managing SSH clients. SSH authenticates the
				devices themselves rather than requiring password authentication to establish a
				connection between an SSH client and server <br><br><br>

				<h1> HOA6 </h1>
					<p><b>Objectives:</b><br><br>
						1.1 Individualize hosts <Br>
						1.2 Apply tags in selecting plays to run <br>
						1.3 Managing Services from remote servers using playbooks <br> <br>
						
						<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
						I do think that the reason why services need to be managed automatically in playbooks is because those services need to be running at all times whenever we run the playbook. It is important because tags are able to save us time as well as simplify the running and debugging of the playbooks. By putting remote servers into our group we are able to specify what tasks should run on different servers. <br><br><br>

				<h1> HOA8 </h1>
					<p><b>Objectives:</b><br><br>
						Create and design a workflow that installs, configure and manage enterprise monitoring tools using Ansible as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. 
						
						<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
						To conclude what I have learned from this activity, I was able to learn how to create .yml file as well as do a detailed step by step instruction of how to install nagios in our server. Basically, nagios is a monitoring tool wherein it helps us to identify the problem when we are sending notification as well as any netork related issue. I have also learned how to debug the program and reminded myself to always check the indention of the commands as well as the spelling of everything I type on the .yml file because even a smallest mistake could lead to the whole file not running.<br><br><br>

					<p><b>Objectives:</b><br><br>
						Create and design a workflow that installs, configure and manage enterprise performance tools using Ansible as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. 
						
						<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
						To conclude, what I have learned from this activity, I can say that debugging the system takes a long time because most of the time that you will spend on it will be on debugging so knowing what to search is very vital, aside from that I have also learned that it is important to know what is the error in the file and to pinpoint at what part you are incorrect. Lastly, I have learned in creating this activity is that the monitoring tool is an essential tool for us to track and check the operation of the system. It also helps us to observe different information and data that we can get in our server/computerbr><br><br>

				<h1> HOA10 </h1>
					<p><b>Objectives:</b><br><br>
						Create and design a workflow that installs, configure and manage enterprise log monitoring tools using Ansible as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.
						
						<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
						To sum it up, doing this activity has helped me greatly because now I understand how to install log monitoring tool. I have also learned that it is kinda hard to debug the error since mostly what we write is the same but just in different servers which if it has error the only thing you need to look out for is the lines which is hard however you can finish it if you have perseverance. I have also learned that using a performance monitoring tool are that it includes numerous tracking techniques that allow us to continuously monitor the performance of their team and provide continuing feedback.r<br><br><br>

						Create a Dockerfile and form a workflow using Ansible as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to enable Continuous Delivery process
						
						<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
						As a result, I conclude that docker containers are used in this activity because they use fewer system resources because they do not include operating system images. Aside from that, it is used because it allows for faster deployment, easier creation of new instances, and faster migrations. In addition, I used the previous knowledge and ability to install docker in web servers and db servers. Docker installation styles differ between Ubuntu and Centos.<br><br><br>

					<p><b>Objectives:</b><br><br>
						Create a workflow to install OpenStack using Ansible as your Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
						
						<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
						I conclude that by utilizing several Ansible playbooks to install In this work, I effectively utilized my understanding of Ansible roles. Furthermore, I now understand that OpenStack is a cloud operating system. Handles virtual resources that are pooled to form clouds Containers are used to stabilize the foundation for clouds because they speed up application delivery while streamlining application deployment and maintenance. Scaling from solitary, compartmentalized teams to corporate operations is possible with OpenStack containers.<br><br><br>

					<p><b>Objectives:</b><br><br>
						Create a workflow to install OpenStack using Ansible as your Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
						
						<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
						As a result, I conclude that I was able to successfully install keystone, glance, and nova, three of the open stack components, during this activity. Image Services for database location and monitoring; Identity Service for database visualization and monitoring that other systems cannot do. Furthermore, I now understand that cloud computing has both benefits and drawbacks. Its advantages include being more secure, less expensive, and more reliable. The disadvantage is that because of all the downtime, it is difficult to find the ideal shop.<br><br><br>

					<p><b>Objectives:</b><br><br>
						Create a workflow to install OpenStack using Ansible as your Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
						<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><br>
						As a result, I conclude that this activity has taught me about various open stack components such as Cinder, Horizon, and Neutron. Each component serves a distinct purpose, such as neutron providing network, Cinder providing block storage, and Horizon providing a web-based interface for administrators and users. I've also transferred my previous knowledge from ansible- playbook to ansible-roles. I made different playbooks for eachgroup and role. Furthermore, there are various types of clouddeployment in openstack, such as On-Premises Distribution, OpenStack-Based Public Cloud, Hosts Open Stack Private Cloud, and so on. In terms of service models, there are ironic, magnum, and sahara, among others.<br><br><br>
